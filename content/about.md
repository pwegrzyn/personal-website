Hi ðŸ‘‹, 

I'm Patryk, a software developer living in KrakÃ³w, Poland. Currently, I'm finishing my Master's in Computer Science at AGH-UST.
I am also part-time employed at Akamai Technologies, Inc. where I work on data propagation systems. In free time, aside from writting software,
I enjoy learning physics, reading books (mostly fantasy and Sci-Fi), watching (and overanalyzing) movies, playing video-games and observing the night sky ðŸ”­
