Hi ðŸ‘‹, 

I'm Patrick, a software engineer from Cracow, Poland. Currently I'm finishing my Master's degree in Computer Science at AGH-UST (specializing in machine learning).
Previously I worked at Akamai Technologies, Inc. where I contributed improvements to data distribution systems underpinning Akamai's global CDN.
My interest are physics, math, machine learning, distributed systems (from Cloud to Blockchains), books and video games (playing and casually developing).
