Hi ðŸ‘‹, 

I'm Patryk, a software engineer in Krakow, Poland. Currently, I'm finishing my Master's degree in Computer Science at AGH-UST; in my thesis I'm studying the geometry of loss landscapes in neural networks. During my undergrad studies I was mainly interested in distributed systems (my Bachelor's thesis was a Blockchain implementation for cryptography classes). I also used to worked as a SWE at Akamai, where I was responsbile for data propagation systems. My interests are distributed systems (theory as well as practice in the form of cloud native technologies and decentralized Web3), machine learning (mainly theoretical research topics), math, physics and economy. In free time I also like to read a lot, watch movies and play some video games.
