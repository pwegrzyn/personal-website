Hi ðŸ‘‹, 

I'm Patryk, a software engineer from Krakow, Poland. Currently I'm finishing my Master's degree in Computer Science at AGH-UST.
Previously I worked at Akamai Technologies, Inc. where I contributed improvements to data distribution systems underpinning Akamai's global CDN.
My interests are physics, math, distributed systems (from cloud to web3), machine learning and books.
